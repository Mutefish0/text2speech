16. PSYCHOLOGY OF TRENDS 
Each price is the momentary consensus of value of all market participants. It 
shows their latest vote on the value of a trading vehicle. Any trader can "put 
in his two cents' worth" by giving an order to buy or to sell, or by refusing to 
trade at the current level. 
Each bar on a chart reflects the battle between bulls and bears. When bulls 
feel strongly bullish, they buy more eagerly and push markets up. When 
bears feel strongly bearish, they sell more actively and push markets down. 
Each price reflects action or lack of action by all traders in the market. 
Charts are a window into mass psychology. When you analyze charts, you 
analyze the behavior of traders. Technical indicators help make this analysis 
more objective. 
Technical analysis is applied social psychology. It aims to recognize 
trends and changes in crowd behavior in order to make intelligent trading 
decisions. 
Strong Feelings 
Ask most traders why prices went up, and you are likely to get a stock 
answer-more buyers than sellers. This is not true. The number of trading 
instruments, such as stocks or futures, bought and sold in any market is 
always equal. 
If you want to buy a contract of Swiss Francs, someone has to sell it to 
you. If you want to sell short a contract of the S&P 500, someone has to buy 
it from you. The number of stocks bought and sold is equal in the stock mar- 
ket. Furthermore, the number of long and short positions in the futures mar- 
kets is always equal. Prices move up or down because of changes in the 
intensity of greed and fear among buyers or sellers. 
When the trend is up, bulls feel optimistic and do not mind paying a little 
extra. They buy high because they expect prices to rise even higher. Bears 
feel tense in an uptrend, and they agree to sell only at a higher price. When 
greedy and optimistic bulls meet fearful and defensive bears, the market ral- 
lies. The stronger their feelings, the sharper the rally. The rally ends only 
when many bulls lose their enthusiasm. 
When prices slide, bears feel optimistic and do not quibble about selling 
short at lower prices. Bulls are fearful and agree to buy only at a discount. 
62 MASS PSYCHOLOGY 
As long as bears feel like winners, they continue to sell at lower prices, and 
the downtrend continues. It ends when bears start feeling cautious and refuse 
to sell at lower prices. 
Rallies and Declines 
Few traders act as purely rational human beings. There is a great deal of 
emotional activity in the markets. Most market participants act on the princi - 
ple of "monkey see, monkey do." The waves of fear and greed sweep up 
bulls and bears. 
Markets rise because of greed among buyers and fear among short sellers. 
Bulls normally like to buy on the cheap. When they turn very bullish, they 
become more concerned with not missing the rally than with getting a cheap 
price. A rally continues as long as bulls are greedy enough to meet sellers' 
demands. 
The sharpness of a rally depends on how traders feel. If buyers feel just a 
little stronger than sellers, the market rises slowly. When they feel much 
stronger than sellers, the market rises fast. It is the job of a technical analyst 
to find when buyers are strong and when they start running out of steam. 
Short sellers feel trapped by rising markets, as their profits melt and turn 
into losses. When short sellers rush to cover, a rally becomes nearly vertical. 
Fear is a stronger emotion than greed, and rallies driven by short covering 
are especially sharp. 
Markets fall because of greed among bears and fear among bulls. 
Normally bears prefer to sell short on rallies, but if they expect to make a lot 
of money on a decline, they don't mind shorting on the way down. Fearful 
buyers agree to buy only below the market. As long as short sellers are will- 
ing to meet those demands and sell at a bid, the decline continues. 
As bulls' profits melt and turn into losses, they panic and sell at almost 
any price. They are so eager to get out that they hit the bids under the mar- 
ket. Markets can fall very fast when hit by panic selling. 
Trend Leaders 
Loyalty is the glue that holds groups together. Freud showed that group 
members relate to their leader the way children relate to a father. Group

members expect leaders to inspire and reward them when they are good but 
to punish them when they are bad. 
Who leads market trends? When individuals try to control a market, they 
usually end up badly. For example, the bull market in silver in the 1980s was 
led by the Hunt brothers of Texas and their Arab associates. The Hunts 
ended up in a bankruptcy court. They had no money left even for a limousine 
and had to ride the subwy to the courthouse. Market gurus sometimes lead 
trends, but they never last beyond one market cycle (see Section 6). 
Tony Plummer, a British trader, has presented a revolutionary idea in his 
book, Forecasting Financial Markets - The Truth Behind Technical Analysis. 
He showed that price itself functions as the leader of the market crowd! Most 
traders focus their attention on price. 
Winners feel rewarded when price moves in their favor, and losers feel 
punished when price moves against them. Crowd members remain blissfilly 
unaware that when they focus on price they create their own leader. Traders 
who feel mesmerized by price swings create their own idols. 
When the trend is up, bulls feel rewarded by a bountiful parent. The longer 
an uptrend lasts, the more confident they feel. When a child's behavior is 
rewarded, he continues to do what he did. When bulls make money, they add to 
long positions and new bulls enter the market. Bears feel they are being pun- 
ished for selling short. Many of tbem cover shorts, go long, and join the bulls. 
Buying by happy bulls and covering by fearful bears pushes uptrends 
higher. Buyers feel rewarded while sellers feel punished. Both feel emotion- 
ally involved, but few traders realize that they are creating the uptrend, creat- 
ing their own leader. 
Eventually a price shock occurs-a major sale hits the market, and there 
are not enough buyers to absorb it. The uptrend takes a dive. Bulls feel mis- 
treated, like children whose father hit them with a strap during a meal, but 
bears feel encouraged. 
A price shock plants the seeds of an uptrend's reversal. Even if the market 
recovers and reaches a new high, bulls feel more skittish and bears become 
bolder. This lack of cohesion in the dominant group and optimism among its 
opponents makes the uptrend ready to reverse. Several technical indicators 
identify tops by tracing a pattern called bearish divergence (see Section 28). It 
occurs when prices reach a new high but the indicator reaches a lower high 
than it did on a previous rally. Bearish divergences mark the best shorting 
opportunities. 
When the trend is down, bears feel like good children, praised and

rewarded for being smart. They feel increasingly confident, add to their posi - 
tions, and the downtrend continues. New bears come into the market. Most 
people admire winners, and the financial media keep interviewing bears in 
bear markets. 
Bulls lose money in downtrends, and that makes them feel bad. Bulls 
dump their positions, and many switch sides to join bears. Their selling 
pushes markets lower. 
After a while, bears grow confident and bulls feel demoralized. Suddenly, 
a price shock occurs. A cluster of buy orders soaks up all available sell 
orders and lifts the market. Now bears feel like children whose father has 
lashed out at them in the midst of a happy meal. 
A price shock plants the seeds of a downtrend's eventual reversal because 
bears become more fearful and bulls grow bolder. When a child begins to 
doubt that Santa Claus exists, he seldom believes in Santa again. Even if 
bears recover and prices fall to a new low, several technical indicators iden - 
tify their weakness by tracing a pattern called a bullish divergence. It occurs 
when prices fall to a new low but an indicator traces a more shallow bottom 
than during the previous decline. Bullish divergences identify the best buy - 
ing opportunities. 
Social Psychology 
An individual has a free will and his behavior is hard to predict. Group 
behavior is more primitive and easier to follow. When you analyze markets, 
you analyze group behavior. You need to identify the direction in which 
groups run and their changes. 
Groups suck us in and cloud our judgment. The problem for most analysts 
is that they get caught in the mentality of the groups they analyze. 
The longer a rally continues, the more technicians get caught up in bullish 
sentiment, ignore the danger signs, and miss the reversal. The longer a 
decline goes on, the more technicians get caught up in bearish gloom and 
ignore bullish signs. This is why it helps to have a written plan for analyzing 
the markets. We have to decide in advance what indicators we will watch 
and how we will interpret them. 
Floor traders use several tools for tracking the quality and intensity of a 
crowd's feelings. They watch the crowd's ability to break through recent 
support and resistance levels. They keep an eye on the flow of "paper" - cus- 
tomer orders that come to the floor in response to price changes. Floor 
17. MANAGING VERSUS FORECASTING 65 
traders listen to the changes in pitch and volume of the roar on the exchange 
floor. 
If you trade away from the floor, you need other tools for analyzing 
crowd behavior. Your charts and indicators reflect mass psychology in 
action. A technical analyst is an applied social psychologist, often armed 
with a computer.
