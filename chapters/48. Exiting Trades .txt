48. EXITING TRADES 
Taking a loss can be emotionally hard, but taking a profit can be even harder. 
You can take a small loss automatically if you have the discipline to set a 
stop the moment you enter a trade. Taking a profit requires more thought. 
When the market moves in your favor, you need to decide whether to stay 
put, get out, or add to your position. 
An amateur can tie his mind into a knot trying to decide what to do about 
a profit. He multiplies the number of ticks by their dollar value and feels a 
surge of greed: Let the trade run, make even more money. Then the market 
ticks against him, and he is hit with a jolt of fear: Grab that profit now, 
before it melts. A trader who acts on his emotions cannot make rational deci - 
sions. 
One of the worst mistakes of traders is counting money while they have 
an open position. Counting money ties your mind into a knot. It interferes 
with your ability to trade rationally. If you catch yourself counting paper 
profits and thinking what you can buy with them -get rid of those thoughts! 
If you cannot get rid of them, get rid of your position. 
If a beginner cashes out too early, he kicks himself for leaving money on 
the table. He decides to hang on the next time, overstays a trade, and loses 
money. If a beginner misses a profit because of a reversal, he grabs the first 
profit on the next trade and may well miss a major move. The market tugs on 
the amateur's emotions and he jerks in response. 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
A trader who responds to his feelings instead of external reality is certain to 
lose. He may grab a profit here and there but will eventually bust out, even if 
his system gives him good trades. Greed and fear destroy traders by clouding 
their minds. The only way to succeed in trading is to use your intellect. 
Quality Before Money 
The goal of a successful trader is to make the best trades. Money is secondary. 
If this surprises you, think how good professionals in any field operate. Good 
teachers, doctors, lawyers, farmers, and others make money - but they do not 
count it while they work. If they do, the quality of their work suffers. 
If you ask your doctor how much money he earned today, he won't be able 
to answer (and if he can, you do not want him for a doctor). Ask your lawyer 
how much money he made today. He may have a general idea that he put in 
some billable hours, but not exactly how many dollars he made. If he counts 
money while he works, you do not want him for a lawyer. A real pro devotes 
all his energy to practicing his craft the best he can - not to counting money. 
Counting money in a trade flashes a red light-a warning that you are 
about to lose because your emotions are kicking in and they will override 
your intellect. That is why it is a good idea to get out of a trade if you cannot 
get money off your mind. 
Concentrate on quality-on finding trades that make sense and having a 
money management plan that puts you in control. Focus on finding good 
entry points and avoid gambles. Then the money will follow almost as an 
afterthought. You may count it later, well after a trade is over. 
A good trader must focus on finding and completing good trades. A pro- 
fessional always studies the markets, looks for opportunities, hones his 
money management skills, and so on. If you ask him how much money he 
made on the current trade, he will have only a general idea of being a little or 
a lot ahead of the game, or a little behind (he can never be a lot behind 
because of tight stops). Like other professionals, he focuses on practicing his 
craft and polishing his skills. He does not count money in a trade. He knows 
that he will make money, as long as he does what is right in the markets. 
Indicator Signals 
If you use indicators for finding trades, use them also to get you out of 
trades. If your indicators are in gear with the market when it is time to buy or 
go short, use them to decide when it is time to sell or to cover. 
48. EXITING TRADES 
A trader often becomes emotionally attached to a trade. Profits give peo- 
ple a high, but even a loss can tingle the nerves, like a scary but exciting ride 
on a roller coaster. When those indicator signals that flagged a trade disap - 
pear, get out of the market fast, regardless of your feelings. 
For example, you may go long because a 13-week EMA has ticked up on 
the weekly charts while daily Stochastic fell into its buy zone. If you go 
long, decide in advance whether you will sell when daily Stochastic rallies 
and becomes overbought or when the 13-week EMA turns down. Write 
down your plan and keep it where you can always see it. 
You may go short because weekly MACD -Histogram ticked down and 
daily Elder -ray gave a sell signal. Decide in advance whether you will cover 
when daily Elder -ray gives a buy signal or when weekly MACD -Histogram 
turns up. You need to decide in advance which signals you will take. There 
will be many signals-and the best time to decide is before you enter a trade. 
Profit Targets, Elliott, and Fibonacci 
Some traders try to establish profit targets. They want to sell strength when 
prices hit resistance or buy weakness when prices reach support. Elliott 
Wave theory is the main method for trying to forecast reversal points. 
R. N. Elliott wrote several articles about the stock market and a book, 
Nature's Law. He believed that every movement in the stock market could 
be broken into waves, smaller waves, and subwaves. Those waves 
explained every turning point and occasionally allowed him to make correct 
predictions. 
Those analysts who sell advisory services based on Elliott's methods 
always come up with so -called "alternate counts. " They explain everything 
in hindsight but are not reliable in dealing with the future. 
Fibonacci numbers and their ratios, especially 1.618, 2.618, and 4.236 
express many relationships in nature. As Trudi Garland writes in her lucid 
book Fascinating Fibonaccis, these numbers express the ratios between the 
diameters of neighboring spirals in a seashell and in a galaxy, the number of 
seeds in the adjacent rows of a sunflower, and so on. Elliott was the first to 
point out that these relationships also apply to the financial markets. 
I Tony Plummer describes in his book Forecasting Financial Markets how 
he uses Fibonacci ratios to decide how far a breakout from a trading range is 
I likely to carry. He measures the height of a trading range, trades in the direc- 
1 tion of a breakout, and then looks for reversal targets by multiplying the 
i height of the range by Fibonacci numbers. Experienced traders combine j 
266 RISK MANAGEMENT 
profit targets with other technical studies. They look for indicator signals at 
the projected turning points. If indicators diverge from a trend that is 
approaching a target, it reinforces the signal to .get out. Trading on targets 
alone can be a tremendous ego boost, but the markets are too complex to be 
handled with a few simple numbers. 
Setting Stops 
Serious traders place stops the moment they enter a trade. As time passes, 
stops need to be adjusted to reduce the amount of money at risk and to pro- 
tect a bigger chunk of profit. Stops should be moved only one way - in the 
direction of the trade. We all like to hope that a trade will succeed-and a 
stop is a piece of reality that prevents traders from hanging on to empty 
hope. 
When you are long, you may keep your stops in place or raise them but 
never lower them. When you are short, you may keep your stops in place or 
lower them but never raise them. Cutting extra slack to a losing trade is a 
loser's game. If a trade is not working out, it shows that your analysis was 
flawed or the market has changed. Then it is time to run fast. 
Serious traders use stops the way sailors use ratchets- to take out the 
slack in their sails. Losers who move stops away from the market vote in 
favor of fantasy and against reality. 
Learning to place stops is like learning to drive defensively. Most of us 
learn the same techniques and we adjust them to fit our personal styles. The 
following are the basic rules for placing stops. 
1. Stop-Loss Order 
Place your stop the moment you enter a trade. Trading without a stop is 
like walking down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan without pants on. It can be 
done, I have seen people do it, but it is not worth the trouble. A stop will 
not protect you from a bad trading system; the best it can do is slow down 
the damage. 
A stop-loss order limits your risk even though it does not always work. 
Sometimes prices gap through a stop. A stop is not a perfect tool but it is the 
best defensive tool we have. 
48. EXITING TRADES 267 
Men you go long, place your stop below the latest minor support level. 
When you go short, place a stop above the latest minor resistance (see 
Section 20). The Parabolic system (see Section 44) moves the stops in the 
direction of the trade, depending on the passage of time and changes in 
prices. If you use the Triple Screen trading system (see Section 43), place 
your stop after entering a trade at the extreme of the past two days' range. 
Avoid all trades where a logical stop would expose more than 2 percent of 
your equity. This limit includes slippage and commissions. 
2. Break-Even Order 
The first few days in a trade are the hardest. You have done your home - 
work, found a trade, and placed an order. It has been filled, and you placed a 
stop-loss order. There is not much else you can do-you are like a pilot 
strapped into his seat for takeoff. The engines are blasting at full power, but 
the speed is low, and there is no room to maneuver-just sit back and trust 
your system. 
As soon as prices start to move in your favor, move your stop to a break- 
even level. When the takeoff is completed, your flight is at a safer stage. 
Now you get to choose between keeping your money or gaining more, 
instead of choosing between a loss and a gain. 
As a rule, prices have to move away from your entry point by more than 
the average daily range before you move your stop to a break-even level. It 
takes judgment and experience to know when to do it. 
When you move a stop to a break-even level, you increase the risk of a 
whipsaw. Amateurs often kick themselves for "leaving money on the 
table." Many amateurs allow themselves only one entry into a trade. There 
is nothing wrong with re-entering a trade after getting stopped out. 
Professionals keep trying to get in until they get a good entry, using tight 
money management. 
3. Protect-Profit Order 
As prices continue to move in your favor, you have to protect your paper 
profits. Paper profit is real money- treat it with the same respect as money 
in your wallet. Risk only a portion of it, as the price of staying in the trade. 
If you are a conservative trader, apply the 2 percent rule to your paper 
profits. This protect-profit order is a "money stop," protecting your equity. 
268 RISK MANAGEMENT 
Keep moving it in the direction of the trade so that no more than 2 percent of 
your growing equity is ever exposed. 
More aggressive traders use the 50 percent rule. If you follow it, half the 
paper profit is yours and half belongs to the market. You can mark the high - 
est high reached in a long trade or the lowest low reached in a short trade, 
and place your stop halfway between that point and your entry point. For 
example, if prices move 10 points in your favor, place a stop to protect 5 
points of profit. 
If in doubt, use the Parabolic system (see Section 44) to help you adjust 
your stops. When you are not sure whether to stay in a trade or not, take 
profits and re -evaluate the situation from the sidelines. There is nothing 
wrong with exiting and re -entering a trade. People think much more clearly 
when they have no money at risk. 
After the Trade 
A trade does not end when you close out your position. You must analyze it 
and learn from it. Many traders throw their confirmation slips into a folder 
and go looking for the next trade. They miss an essential part of growing to 
become a professional trader - review and self -analysis. 
Have you identified a good trade? Which indicators were useful and 
which did not work? How good was your entry? Was the initial stop too far 
or too close? Why and by how much? Did you move your stop to a break- 
even level too early or too late? Were your protect -profit stops too loose or 
too tight? Did you recognize the signals to exit a trade? What should you 
have done differently? What did you feel at the various stages of the trade? 
This analysis is an antidote against emotional trading. 
Ask yourself these and other questions and learn from your experiences. 
A cool, intelligent analysis does you more good than gloating about profits 
or wallowing in regrets. 
Start keeping a "before and after" notebook. Whenever you enter a posi- 
tion, print out the current charts. Paste them on the left page of your note - 
book and jot down your main reasons for buying or shorting. Write down 
your plan for managing the trade. 
When you exit, print the charts again and paste them on the right page of 
your notebook. Write down your reasons for exiting and list what you did 
right or wrong. You will have a pictorial record of your trades and thoughts. 
This notebook will help you learn from the past and discover blind spots in 
yyour thinking. Learn from history and profit from your experiences. 
Afterword 
One hot summer, in the mountains of northern Italy, I sat down to draft the 
first outline of this book. Two and a half years later, on a frigid January in 
New York City, I printed out its last chart. I wrote and rewrote this book 
three times, to make it clearer and to reflect my growing experience. 
I have changed as a person, and my methods continue to evolve. If I could 
work on this manuscript for another two and a half years, it would become a 
different book, but it is time to let go. 
Pulling the Trigger 
Traders sometimes confide in me that they have trouble "pulling the trig - 
ger''- buying or selling when their methods tell them to go long or short. I 
had this problem once, for a very short time. My friend Lou, to whom this 
book is dedicated, helped me get rid of it. 
One Sunday afternoon I mentioned to Lou that I saw several attractive 
trades but doubted I'd take any of them the following week because I had 
recently gotten beat up in the markets. Lou, who is usually cool and mild- 
mannered, suddenly began yelling. "I want you to trade at the opening on 
Monday!" I did not feel like trading-I was afraid of losing. "I don't give a 
shit whether you win or lose - trade tomorrow at the open!" I seldom trade at 
the open, but I could trade 10 minutes later, looking for an opening range 
breakout. "10 minutes is OK, but trade tomorrow!" 
I thought about what had happened and realized what my problem was. I 
was like a skier at the top of the hill who had taken a bad spill and was afraid 
to go down again. Whatever my technique, if I was afraid to go downhill, I 
could not be a skier.

2 70 AFTERWORD 
have. There is no way to handle this problem with ease and comfort. It has to 
be handled hard, by a sheer effort of will, which is why Lou yelled at me- 
as a friend. 
You need to design a system or borrow one from this book and adapt it to 
your needs. Skiers do a little practice on a bunny slope, and you can paper- 
trade. Design a sensible money management plan, using the 2 percent rule. 
Limit your monthly losses to the maximum of 6 percent or 8 percent of your 
risk capital. At this point you are like a skier, ready at the top of the hill. 
Push off when your system flags you to go! Push off now! 
If you do not go downhill when the flag comes down, you might as well 
sell your skis and take up golf or raise goldfish. In other words, forget about 
trading. 
Now you have a system, you've learned money management rules, you 
know the psychological rules for cutting losses. Now you must trade. Can 
you? Traders try to weasel out of making this decision. They papertrade for 
years, buy automatic trading systems, and so on. Several traders have even 
asked me to hypnotize them. These games must end. It is time to make an 
effort of will! 
Consider this book my friendly yell at you. 
The Endless Trail 
Markets change, new opportunities emerge, and old ones melt away. Good 
traders are successful but humble people - they always learn. Being a trader 
is a lifelong challenge. 
I hope this book helps you to grow as a trader. If you have read this far, 
you must be serious about your work. Take this book for what it is- a 
description of what's on one trader's mind and how he goes about solving 
problems that all of us face. Take the ideas that appeal to you, and shape 
them to fit your style. 
If you believe that being a trader is worth the effort- as I decided years 
ago-my best wishes to you. I continue to learn, and like any trader, I 
reserve the right to be smarter tomorrow than I am today. 
Acknowledgments 
After finishing a project of several years, I owe a sweet debt of gratitude to 
hundreds of persons- teachers, friends, and clients. If you do not see your 
name here, please forgive me, and I'll thank you in pcrson the next time we 
meet. 
Thanks, first of all, to all the clients of Financial Trading Seminars, Inc. 
Often a phone would ring and a trader would ask for "Dr. Elder's book." The 
book was not written yet, not advertised anywhere-but clients expected a 
book from me. That was terrific encouragement. 
Writing a book was a hard job, but it helped me organize my thoughts and 
become a better trader. Two friends provided a soft push at the birth of this 
project. First, Tim Slater invited me to seminars in Asia, and then Martin 
Pring introduced me to people at WEFA, which led to a conference in Italy. 
Walking with Tim through Snake Alley to a smoky restaurant in Taipei and, 
a few months later, sitting in a cafe in Milan with Martin, I felt friendly but 
unmistakable pressure to organize my thoughts and start writing. 
The blank screen of a word processor seemed huge and forbidding. To get 
the job rolling, I offered a number of seminars and taped some of them. 
Those transcripts helped me flesh out the ideas for this book. Thanks to all 
the analysts and traders in New York and Toronto, London and Singapore 
who came to my seminars, listened, and asked hundreds of questions. Some 
were experts whose comments forced me to stretch my mind farther than I 
expected; others were beginners whose questions served as a reminder to 
keep my feet on the ground. I hope you are all making money trading. 
Three persons, a colleague and two patients, have opened my mind to the 
idea of 12 Steps - a major factor in my improvement as a trader. Thank you, 
Dagmar O'Connor, Jim S., and Kathy H. (Kathy died last year, after a long 
battle with cancer, and visiting her for months in a hospice reinforced my 
belief that there are values more important than money.) Thanks to the pro- 
272 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
fessional traders who came to consult with me as a psychiatrist and entrusted 
me with their confidence. You reinforced my conviction that if you get your 
head in order, money tends to flow in. 
Great thanks to everybody who works for my company, Financial Trading 
Seminars, Inc. It is a unique group of people-intelligent, dynamic, and fun 
to be with. Each has been selected from dozens if not hundreds of appli- 
cants -you are the best. Thanks especially to our managers - Carol Keegan 
Kayne and Inga Boguslavsky. Carol helped me edit every chapter. We had 
many passionate arguments about the language, most of which Carol won, 
and if you have any complaints about the clarity of this book, I'll give you 
her number. 
Once the manuscript was ready, I divided it into a dozen sections and 
mailed each to a top expert in the field. These busy and successful people 
found time to review several chapters each and suggested many improve- 
ments. In addition to the friends already mentioned, they included Gerald 
Appel, Stephen Briese, Ralph Cato, Mark Douglas, John Ehlers, Perry 
Kaufman, Tony Plummer, Fred Schutzman, Bo Thunman, Ralph 
Vince, and 
David Weis. Thank you for being so generous with your time and advice. If 
the market is a minus-sum game, then having friends like you is an espe- 
cially big plus! 
Thanks to the analysts who wrote before me. It was often hard to find who 
was first- there is a thicket of conflicting claims in our field. As Henry 
Kissinger once said, "Academic fights are so bitter because the stakes are so 
small." Most charts in this book were drawn using CompuTrac software on 
an IBM-compatible and imported into 
PageMakerB for the Macintosh. 
Thanks to Norbert Rudek for helping to set up the system and for unstinting 
phone support. Thanks to the editors at Barron 's, Futures, Technical Analysis 
of Stocks and Commodities, Futures and Options World, and other maga- 
zines for encouraging me to write articles and book and software reviews - it 
was a good training for the book. 
Many thanks to Stephen Reibel, M.D., a fellow psychiatrist and a former 
boss at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center for covering my practice. I can 
go and teach all over the world knowing that my patients in New York are in 
good hands. 
Lou Taylor, to whom this book is dedicated, has offered a treasury of 
superb ideas. I wish he would write a book. His wise advice made a huge 
difference at several important turning points. My family, especially Miriam, 
Nicole, and Danny, provided cheerful support and a happy diversion from 
business.

Finally, I want to thank my friend from way back when, Nicolai 
Gorbunoff. A scientist, he was destroyed by the Soviet system when I was 
but a teenager. In the closed, Communist party-dominated world that we 
lived in, he planted a simple but revolutionary idea in my mind: that the only 
standard for research and work was the "world class." You had to strive to be 
among the best in the world, or else it did not pay to try. Thank you Nicolai, 
and thank you, all my friends.
