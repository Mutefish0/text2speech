27. THE DIRECTIONAL SYSTEM 
The Directional system is a trend-following method. It was developed by J. 
Welles Wilder, Jr., in the mid-1970s and modified by several analysts. The 
Directional system identifies trends and shows when a trend is moving fast 
enough to make it worth following. It helps traders take chunks of profit out 
of the middle of important trends. 
How to Construct the Directional System 
Directional Movement is defined as the portion of today's range that is out- 
side of the previous day's range. The Directional system checks whether

3 are based on positive and negative directional movements 
and the true ranges of the past 13 days. DX is derived from 
+Dl1 3 and 
-Dl1 3, and ADX is made by smoothing DX. See formulas in the chapter. Date : .............

today's range extends above or below the previous day's range and averages 
that data over a period of time. These complex calculations (see worksheet, 
Figure 27-1) are best performed on a computer. The Directional system is 
included in most software programs for technical analysis. 
27. THE DIRECTIONAL SYSTEM 137 
1. Identify "Directional Movement " (DM) by comparing today's high- 
to-low range with yesterday's high -to-low range. Directional 
Movement is the largest part of today's range outside of yesterday's 
range. There are four types of DM (Figure 27 -2). DM is always a posi - 
tive number (+DM and -DM refer simply to movement above or 
below yesterday's range). 
2. Identify the "True Range" (TR) of the market you analyze. It is 
always a positive number, the largest of three: 
A. The distance from today's high to today's low 
B. The distance from today's high to yesterday's close 
C. The distance from today's low to yesterday's close 
3. Calculate daily Directional Indicators (+DI and -DI). They allow 
you to compare different markets by expressing their directional 
movement as a percentage of each market's true range. Each DI is a 
positive number: +DI equals zero on a day that has no directional 
movement up; -DI equals zero on a day that has no directional move - 
ment down. 
4. Calculate smoothed Directional Lines (+DI13 and -DI13). Smooth 
+DI and -DI are created with moving averages. Most software pack - 
ages allow you to pick any period for smoothing, such as a 13-day 
moving average. You get two indicator lines: smoothed Positive and 
Negative Directional lines, +DI13 and 
-DI13. Both numbers are posi - 
tive. They are usually plotted in different colors, or as a solid and a 
dashed line. 
The relationship between Positive and Negative lines identifies trends. 
When +DI13 is on top, it shows that the trend is up, and when -DI13 
is on top, it shows that the trend is down. The crossovers of +DI13 and 
-DII3 give buy and sell signals. 
5. Calculate the Average Directional Indicator (ADX). This unique 
component of Directional system shows when a trend is worth follow - 
ing. ADX measures the spread between Directional Lines +D113 and 
-DI13. It is calculated in two steps:

Figure 27-2. Directional Movement 
Directional Movement is the largest part of today's range that is outside of 
yesterday's range. 
A. If today's range extends above yesterday's range, Directional 
Movement is positive (+DM). 
B. If today's range extends below yesterday's range, Directional 
Movement is negative (-DM). 
C. If today's range is inside of yesterday's range or extends above and 
below it by equal amounts, there is no Directional Movement (DM = 
0). If today's range extends both above and below yesterday's range, 
DM is positive or negative, depending on which part of the "outside 
range" is larger. 
D. On a limit up day, +DM equals the distance from today's close to yes- 
terday's high. On a limit down day, -DM equals the distance from 
today's close to yesterday's low. 
A. Calculate the daily Directional Indicator DX: 
27. THE DIRECTIONAL SYSTEM 139 
For example, +DI13 = 34; -DI13 = 18. Then, 
34- 18 16 
DX = 100 = 100 = 30.77, rounded off = 31 
34 + 18 52 
B. Calculate the Average Directional Indicator ADX by smoothing 
DX with a moving average, such as a 13-day EMA. 
When a trend proceeds in a healthy manner, the spread between two 
smoothed Directional lines increases and ADX rises. ADX declines when a 
trend reverses or when a market enters a trading range. It pays to use a trend- 
following method when ADX rises and not when ADX declines. 
Crowd Behavior 
The Directional system tracks changes in mass bullishness and bearishness 
by measuring the capacity of bulls and bears to move prices outside of the 
previous day's range. If today's high is above yesterday's high, it shows that 
the market crowd is becoming more bullish. If today's low is below yester - 
day's low, it shows that the market crowd is becoming more bearish. 
The relative position of Directional lines identifies trends. When the 
Positive Directional line is above the Negative Directional line, it shows that 
bullish traders dominate the market. When the Negative Directional line 
rises above the Positive Directional line, it shows that bearish traders are 
stronger. It pays to trade in the direction of the upper Directional line. 
The Average Directional Indicator ADX rises when the spread between 
Directional lines increases. This shows that market leaders are becoming 
stronger, losers are getting weaker, and the trend is likely to continue. When 
the ADX rises, it pays to trade in the direction of the upper Directional line, 
using a trend -following method. 
ADX declines when the spread between 
 +DI13 and 
-DI13 narrows down. 
This shows that the dominant market group is losing its strength, while the 
underdogs are gaining. Then the market is in turmoil, and it is better not to 
use trend-following methods. 
Trading Rules 
1. Trade only from the long side when 
 +DI13 is above -DI13. Trade only 
from the short side when -Dll3 is above 
+DII3. The best time to be 
long is when both 
 +DI13 and ADX are above -DI13 and ADX rises. 
This shows that the uptrend is getting stronger. Go long and place a 
140 COMPUTERIZED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 
protective stop below the latest minor low. The best time to be short is 
when -DI13 and ADX are above +Dll3 and ADX rises. This shows 
that bears are becoming stronger. Go short and place a protective stop 
above the latest minor high.

Figure 27-3. Signals of the Directional System 
Directional lines identify trends. When +Dl is on top, the trend is up, 
and it pays to trade the market from the long side. When 
-Dl is on top, it 
shows that the trend is down and it pays to trade the market from the 
short side. The best time to use a trend-following method is when ADX is 
rising and is above the lower Directional line. Those are two signs of 
dynamic trends. 
The Directional system gives its best signals after ADX spends several 
weeks below both Directional lines. That happens in quiet, dull markets. 
Once ADX "wakes up" and rises by four steps (for example, from 10 to 
14), it gives a strong signal to trade in the direction of the upper 
Directional line. It often flashes this signal at the beginning of major mar - 
ket moves. On this chart, ADX rallied from 9 to 13 in September, just 
prior to a dynamic rally in the Japanese Yen. Since the +Dl was on top 
when the signal occurred, it signalled to go long. 
27. THE DIRECTIONAL SYSTEM 141 
tional. There are usually many whipsaws, just as there are turbulences 
in the water during the change of tide. When ADX points down, it is 
better not to use a trend-following method. 
3. When ADX falls below both Directional lines, it identifies a flat, 
sleepy market. Do not use a trend -following system but start getting 
ready, because major trends emerge from such lulls. 
4. The single best signal of the Directional system comes after ADX falls 
below both Directional lines. The longer it stays there, the stronger the 
base for the next move. When ADX rallies from below both Directional 
lines, it shows that the market is waking up from a lull. When ADX 
rises by four steps (i.e., from 9 to 13) from its lowest point below both 
Directional lines, it "rings a bell" on a new trend. It shows that a new 
bull market or bear market is being born (Figure 27-3). Buy if +DI13 is 
on top and place a stop below the latest minor low. Sell short if 
-DII3 is 
on top and place a stop above the latest minor high. 
For example, if ADX rises from 8 to 12 while both lines are above 12 
and +DIZ3 is on top, it indicates that a new uptrend is beginning. If 
ADX rises from 9 to 13 while both lines are above 13 and 
-DI13 is on 
top, it shows that a new downtrend is starting. 
The Directional System is unique in telling you when a major new trend is 
likely to begin. It rings a bell once or twice a year in any given market. It 
signals when a new baby bull or baby bear is being born. Monetary risk is 
usually low at that time, due to low volatility while the trend is still young. 
5. When ADX rallies above both Directional lines, it identifies an over - 
heated market. When ADX turns down from above both Directional 
lines, it shows that the major trend has stumbled. It is a good time to 
take profits. If you trade multiple contracts, you definitely want to take 
partial profits. 
Market indicators give hard signals and soft signals. For example, a viola - 
tion of a price low or a change in direction of a moving average are hard sig - 
nals. A downturn of ADX is a soft signal. Once you see ADX turn down, 
you ought to be very, very careful about adding to positions. You should start 
taking profits, reducing positions, and looking to get out of your position 
rather than adding to it.
