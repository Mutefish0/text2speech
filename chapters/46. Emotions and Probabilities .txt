46. EMOTIONS AND PROBABILITIES 
Trading is so exciting that it often makes amateurs feel high. A trade for 
them is like a ticket to a movie or a professional ballgame. Trading is a much 
more expensive entertainment than the cinema. 
Nobody can get high and make money at the same time. Emotional trad- 
ing is the enemy of success. Greed and fear are bound to destroy a trader. 
You need to use your intellect instead of trading on gut feeling. 
A trader who gets giddy from profits is like a lawyer who starts counting 
cash in the middle of a trial. A trader who gets upset at losses is like a sur- 
geon who faints at the sight of blood. A real professional does not get too 
excited about wins or losses. 
The goal of a successful professional in any field is to reach his personal 
best - to become the best doctor, the best lawyer, or the best trader. Money 
flows to them almost as an afterthought. You need to concentrate on trading 
right - and not on the money. Each trade has to be handled like a surgical 
procedure - seriously, soberly, without sloppiness or shortcuts. 
Why Johnny Can't Sell 
A loser cannot cut his losses quickly. When a trade starts going sour, he 
hopes and hangs on. He feels that he cannot afford to get out, meets his mar- 
46. EMOTIONS AND PROBABILITIES 
gin calls, and keeps hoping for a reversal. His paper loss grows until what 
seemed like a bad loss starts looking like a bargain. Finally, his broker forces 
him to bite the bullet and take his punishment. As soon as he gets out of a 
trade, the market comes roaring back. 
The loser is ready to smash his head against the wall - had he hung on, he 
would have made a small fortune on the reversal. Trends reverse when they 
do because most losers are alike. They act on their gut feelings instead of 
using their heads. The emotions of people are similar, regardless of their cul- 
tural backgrounds or educational levels. A frightened trader with sweaty 
palms and a pounding heart feels the same whether he grew up in New York 
or Hong Kong and whether he had 2 years or 20 years of schooling. 
Roy Shapiro, a New York psychologist from whose article this subtitle is 
borrowed, writes: 
With great hope, in the private place where we make our trading decisions, our 
current idea is made ready. . . . one difficulty in selling is the attachment expe - 
rienced toward the position. After all, once something is ours, we naturally 
tend to become attached to it. . . . This attachment to the things we buy has 
been called the "endowment effect" by psychologists and economists and we 
all recognize it in our financial transactions as well as in our inability to part 
with that old sports jacket hanging in the closet. 
The speculator is the parent of the idea. . . . the position takes on meaning 
as a personal extension of self, almost as one's child might. . . . Another rea - 
son that Johnny does not sell, even when the position may be losing ground, is 
because he wants to dream. . . . For many, at the moment of purchase critical 
judgment weakens and hope ascends to govern the decision process. 
Dreaming in the markets is a luxury that nobody can afford. If your 
trades are based on dreams, you are better off putting your money into 
psychotherapy. 
Dr. Shapiro describes a test that shows how people conduct business 
involving a chance. First, a group of people are given a choice: a 75 percent 
chance to win $1000 with a 25 percent chance of getting nothing - or a sure 
$700. Four out of five subjects take the second choice, even after it is 
explained to them that the first choice leads to a $750 gain over time. The 
majority makes the emotional decision and settles for a smaller gain. 
Another test is given: People have to choose between a sure loss of $700 
or a 75 percent chance of losing $1000 and a 25 percent chance of losing 
nothing. Three out of four take the second choice, condemning themselves to 
lose $50 more than they have to. In trying to avoid risk, they maximize 
losses!

256 RISK MANAGEMENT 
Emotional traders want certain gains and turn down profitable wagers that 
involve uncertainty. They go into risky gambles to avoid taking certain 
losses. It is human nature to take profits quickly and postpone taking losses. 
Irrational behavior increases when people feel under pressure. According to 
Dr. Shapiro, "bets on long shots increase in the last two races of the day." 
Emotional trading destroys losers. If you review your trading records, you 
will see that the real damage to your account was done by a few large losses 
or by long strings of losses while trying to trade your way out of a hole. 
Good money management would have kept you out of the hole in the first 
place. 
Probability and Innumeracy 
Losing traders look for "a sure thing," hang on to hope, and irrationally 
avoid accepting small losses. Their trading is based on emotions. Losers do 
not understand the key concepts of probability. They have no grasp of odds 
or random processes and have many superstitions about them. 
Innumeracy -not knowing the basic notions of probability, chance, and 
randomness - is a fatal intellectual weakness in traders. Those simple ideas 
can be learned from many basic books. 
The lively book Innumeracy by John Allen Paulos is an excellent primer 
on the concepts of probability. Paulos describes being told by a seemingly 
intelligent person at a cocktail party: "If the chance of rain is 50 percent on 
Saturday and 50 percent on Sunday, then it is 100 percent certain it will be a 
rainy weekend." Someone who understands so little about probability is sure 
to lose money trading. You owe it to yourself to develop a basic grasp of 
mathematical concepts involved in trading. 
Ralph Vince begins his important book Portfolio Management Formulas 
with a delightful paragraph: "Toss a coin in the air. For an instant you experi - 
ence one of the most fascinating paradoxes of nature - the random process. 
While the coin is in the air there is no way to tell for certain whether it will 
land heads or tails. Yet over many tosses the outcome can be reasonably pre- 
dicted." 
Mathematical expectation is an important concept for traders. It is called 
the player's edge (a positive expectation) or the house advantage (a negative 
expectation), depending on who the odds in a game favor. If you and I flip a 
coin, neither of us has an edge- each has a 50 percent chance of winning. 
But if you flip a coin in a casino that skims 10 percent from every pot, you 
will win only 90 cents for every dollar you lose. This "house advantage " cre- 
47. MONEY MANAGEMENT 257 
ates a negative mathematical expectation for you. No system for money 
management can beat a negative expectation game over a period of time. 
A Positive Expectation 
If you know how to count cards in blackjack, you can have an edge against a 
casino (unless they detect you and throw you out. Casinos love drunk gam - 
blers but hate card counters). An edge lets you win more often than you lose 
over a period of time. Good money management can help you make more 
money frbm your edge and minimize losses. Without an edge, you might as 
well give money to charity. In trading, the edge comes from a system that 
delivers greater profits than losses, slippage, and commissions. No money 
management method can rescue a bad trading system. 
You can win only if you trade with a positive mathematical 
 expectation- 
a sensible trading system. Trading on hunches leads to disasters. Many 
traders act like drunks wandering through a casino, going from game to 
game. Slippage and commissions destroy those who overtrade. 
The best trading systems are crude and robust. They are made of a few 
elements. The more complex the systems, the more elements that can break. 
Traders love to optimize their systems using past data. The trouble is, your 
broker won't let you trade the past. Markets change, and the ideal parameters 
from the past may be no good today. Try to de-optimize your system 
instead -check how it would have performed under bad conditions. A robust 
system holds up well when markets change. It is likely to beat a heavily opti - 
mized system in real world trading. 
Finally, when you develop a good system, don't mess with it. Design 
another one if you like to tinker. As Robert Prechter put it: "Most traders 
take a good system and destroy it by trying to make it into a perfect system. " 
Once you have your trading system, it is time to set the rules for money 
management.
